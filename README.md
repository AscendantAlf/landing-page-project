# landing-page-project
HTML and CSS. One of the projects in the Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. Made from scratch and as a draft for my future personal website

Wow. Just wow. I actually drew up a sketch of the boxes needed
on a scratch sheet of paper, so I know what divs I needed. Even
then, still wow. It took a while, although I'm proud with the result.

Albeit, the color choices may not jive well and some of the 
gaps and margins may be slightly jarring, but it's done. On the
contrary, the margins and gaps and widths I used make the page
look fantastic on smaller displays (while still passable on full
desktop website)

I also used my own text size and text color preferences instead of the suggestions.

Originally, I had some spacing problems between text elements(header that says - "full-stack web dev" was a
bit too far up from the subtext). That was because I used flex-direction:column.

I fixed it a bit arbitrarily (via negative top margins)

Alhamdulilah. i really put work into this project
